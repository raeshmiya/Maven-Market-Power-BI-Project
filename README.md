# Maven-Market-Power-BI-Project
I played the role of Lead Business Intelligence Analyst for Adventure Works Cycles, a global manufacturing company. I've designed and delivered a professional-quality, end-to-end business intelligence solution, armed only with Power BI and a handful of raw csv files.

Transformed the cluttered data into rich visuals for enhanced decision making:
1. Connected to the source files, shaped and transformed tables, and use Power Query editing tools to modify, merge and append the data.

2. Created table relationships to blend the extracted information together within a single normalized data model.

3. To exceed the limits in terms of the metrics, performed data engineering - powerboats formula, language, data analysis, expressions, DACs.

4. Developed visual reports, KPI Scorecards, and dashboards which helps to take business decisions and create strategies.
